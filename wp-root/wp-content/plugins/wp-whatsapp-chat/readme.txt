== Formerly WhatsApp Chat ==
This plugin was formerly known as "WhatsApp Chat". WordPress forced us on August 8, 2019 to change the name of the plugin due to use of the "WhatsApp" word in the name. We apologize for the problems that the downtime may have caused to you.

== Why WhatsApp? ==
WhatsApp is these days, the most popular instant messaging application in the world. Is available in more than 100 countries and supporting more than 50 languages.
This means most of our users use WhatsApp as their main contact method, and they probably have been using it for years. Therefore, offering easy access from our website is a good way to convert those visitors into customers.
Generating leads is the key to every business success, and the Social Chat button can help you to increase your overall sales and reach this goal.

== WhatsApp Button ==
With the Social Chat button, your visitors will be allowed to send a message directly to your phone number. To start configuring it, you have to go to the button tab inside the Social Chat section that you can find in your admin dashboard.
Inside the button tab, you wil be able to switch between two different layouts, and to define if you want to include rounded edges, also the position where you want to show the WhatsApp button, the text to be displayed inside, the WhatsApp phone number and the default user message.

== Social Chat Box ==
Social Chat also allows you to include a box to show some contact information and a personalized message. This box can be activated through the Box tab inside the Social Chat section, and there also you can define the header and footer message, contact name, phone, work, and an avatar.
