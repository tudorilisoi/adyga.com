== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements for SnapShots =

You need [WP CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) installed (at least version 2.2) and PHP must be able to execute external programs with PHPs [`exec`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php)

= Does it work without WP CLI? =

No, WP CLI is essential here and SnapShots will not work without it. You will not be able to activate the plugin without the addon.

= Does it work with "Local" =

Yes, the plugin has been tested with the [amazing tool](https://localwp.com/) from WPEngine and works out of the box.

= Snapshots requires the php in your PATH environment =

SnapShots tries to find the `php` binary on your system. If it can't find it, you will get this error. You can define the location of your `php` binary by open your terminal and running

```
dirname $(which php)
```

This returns the directory of your php binary. Use this location to define the constant `SNAPSHOTS_PHP_PATH` in your `wp-config.php` file. For example:

```
define( 'SNAPSHOTS_PHP_PATH', '/usr/local/bin' );
```

**Don't include the `php` binary in the path!**

= Your Home URLs do not match =

Snapshots checks if the home URL of your site matches the one from `wp option get home`. If they are not equal it often that the `DB_HOST` variable is not defined correctly. This also happens if you use a socket for your MySql connection (Local WP).

Update your DB_HOST variable in your `wp-config.php` file to something like this:

```
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost:/tmp/ysql/mysqld.sock' );
```

This should not affect the regular usage of your site. If you encounter any problems, You can wrap the statement like so:

```
if ( defined( 'WP_CLI' ) && WP_CLI ) {
    define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost:/tmp/ysql/mysqld.sock' );
}else{
    define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
}
```

= Snapshots requires the "exec" method =

SnapShots uses the PHP [`exec`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php) method to execute the WP CLI commands.

```

= Snapshots requires WP-CLI! =

SnapShots requires the [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) to be installed on your system. Please install it and make sure it is available in your `PATH` environment.
